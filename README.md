## Description

**Chordion** is a handy reference on chord construction. It can be your companion in practicing, playing a musical instrument, or making music. You can see the chord formula with the notes that make up the chord. You can also listen to the sound of the chord.

Choose a start note/ root note, octave, and chord type, then you can see the chord formula with the chord notes. When you select a chord type, you will also hear how the chord sounds.
